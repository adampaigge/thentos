# Intro

This file collects feature plans and half-done or un-done code
fragments to be kept out of master (as well as the issue tracker)
because there is no requirement for them yet.  Hopefully, this will be
useful as reference in the future.


# List ot things

- github single-sign-on (sso)
  git checkout 2015-09-28-github-sso

- a system for public-key certification.  this could be used by
  services that aim at full, server-less distribution with
  pseudonymous identities.  the identities could be sybil attack
  proof, because you can only get exactly one for every qualified
  thentos user you control.  and they could be highly anonymous if we
  manage to weave in blind signature schemes intelligently.
