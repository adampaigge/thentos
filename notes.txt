Generally:
  - "works" isn't a very useful description for tests. Hopefully all of them
  are in some way testing that things work...
  - "pending" - shouldn't the person who implements a feature be responsible
  for testing it? If s/he doesn't, can we realistically expect anyone else to?
  (Or would it even be fair?)
  - Many tests say they're testing one thing, but really only check status
  codes.

Specifically:

* Is any of MetaSpec.hs useful?
  - We're testing hspec in specFoo
  - We're testing our tests in setupTestServerFullSpec

* What is ThentosSpec.hs about?
  - spec = return () ?

* Thentos/Transaction/CoreSpec.hs spec_polyQU
  - mentions three functions that are never actually used in the tests
  - seems to be basically just testing that id == id

* Thentos/TypesSpec.hs "ThentosLabel,.."
  - It looks to me like we're testing another library, and not our own?

* Thentos/Test/CustomDB.hs
  - Why are we extending the DB in the tests? Anything that uses that won't be
  testing the real DB

* Thentos/Backend/Api/SimpleSpec.hs
  - Some endpoints that have been commented out don't seem to exist. I'm
  removing those tests.
  - Some tests don't even say what the test is supposed to be, and I can't
  figure it out. Since if we want to know what's not being tested we have the
  more reliable method of using coverage reports, I'm removing these.
  - Some comments mention distinctions between "/session" and "/session/".
  Those endpoints don't exist. I'm removing the comment.
  - "responds with an error if password is wrong" - I don't see which password
  would be wrong. Removing.


Non-tests:

  - Lots of endpoints return and expect top-level balues.
  - Some endpoints in ThentosThentosSession and ThentosServiceSession return a
  bool (boolean blindness).
  - I don't see the point of endpoints that return whether a user is logged in.
  - Having multiple endpoints with the same method and same url but different
  request body types is bad for error messages.
  - The API is not at all self-descriptive in terms of indicating what an
  endpoint does from the URL (esp. ThentosThentosSession and
  ThentosServiceSession).
  - IMPORTANT! I modified lookupThentosSession in Thentos.Action since it
  seemed to me like Admin should be allowed to check whether sessions exist
  (well, modulo the question of why anyone would need that in the first place).
