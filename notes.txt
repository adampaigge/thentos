Generally:
  - "works" isn't a very useful description for tests. Hopefully all of them
  are in some way testing that things work...
  - "pending" - shouldn't the person who implements a feature be responsible
  for testing it? If s/he doesn't, can we realistically expect anyone else to?
  (Or would it even be fair?)

Specifically:

* Is any of MetaSpec.hs useful?
  - We're testing hspec in specFoo
  - We're testing our tests in setupTestServerFullSpec

* What is ThentosSpec.hs about?
  - spec = return () ?

* Thentos/Transaction/CoreSpec.hs spec_polyQU
  - mentions three functions that are never actually used in the tests
  - seems to be basically just testing that id == id

* Thentos/TypesSpec.hs "ThentosLabel,.."
  - It looks to me like we're testing another library, and not our own?

* Thentos/Test/CustomDB.hs
  - Why are we extending the DB in the tests? Anything that uses that won't be
  testing the real DB
