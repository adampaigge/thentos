# Thentos Terminology

## Introduction

Let's start with explaining the obvious.

Users, names, roles, groups, persmissions, etc. are names for rather
abstract concepts.  As it goes with abstraction, having a good
intuition of their practical meaning can be hard.  Different software
systems use different abstractions and thus use the same names with
different meaning without always being aware of the differences.

This document is attempt to establish common terminology and make it
accessible for everybody who gets in contact with thentos.

As https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy3.mercator is the first web app to
use thentos, we are covering the terminology for that, too.  Other web
apps will have different terms and concepts, and this document may be
extended in the future to cover more.
